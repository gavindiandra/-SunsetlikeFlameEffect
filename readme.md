Sunset-like Flame Effect with JavaScript
This simple JavaScript code generates a sunset-like flame effect on a canvas element in a web browser.

Description
The code creates a canvas element dynamically in the browser and sets its size to fit the entire window. It then draws a sunset effect on the canvas using a radial gradient, starting from orange at the bottom and transitioning to yellow towards the top.

Usage
Include the index.js file in your HTML document.
Ensure there is an empty <div> or another suitable container in your HTML for the canvas to be appended to.
When the page loads, the script will automatically render the sunset-like flame effect on the canvas.
